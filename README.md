# 🌍 Meeting Time Finder

A simple, elegant web app that solves one annoying problem: finding the perfect meeting time across multiple time zones.

## The Problem

Remote teams waste time converting meeting times across time zones. "Is 2 PM EST good for you?" requires mental math and timezone lookups.

## The Solution

Meeting Time Finder lets you:
- Select a time once
- Add multiple time zones
- See all times instantly
- Identify business hours at a glance
- Copy all times to share with your team

## Features

✨ **Simple & Fast** - No sign-up, no configuration, just works  
🎨 **Clean Design** - Beautiful, distraction-free interface  
📱 **Mobile Friendly** - Works perfectly on any device  
💾 **Remembers Your Zones** - Saves your frequently used time zones  
📋 **One-Click Copy** - Share meeting times instantly  
🟡 **Business Hours Highlight** - Quickly spot 9-5 working hours  

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No frameworks or dependencies
- Client-side only (no backend)
- Uses browser's Intl API for accurate timezone conversion

## Why This Exists

As a remote worker, I was tired of:
- Opening multiple timezone converter tabs
- Doing mental math for meeting times
- Asking "What time is that for you?"
- Using bloated apps with features I don't need

So I built this. One purpose. Done well.
